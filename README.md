# linux-page-fault-experiment

This repository contains a Linux kernel module that obtains the details of a
process's page faults. We use this to briefly analyze page faults on a modern
Linux system.

In particular, we cover the behavior resulting from random, sequential, and
striding file access.

The written report can be read [here](report/report.pdf).
